# Protein-Protein Interaction Network of Breast Cancer Genes

This project fetches protein interaction data from STRING for a small list of breast-cancer genes,
builds a network using NetworkX, and visualizes it.

Files:
- ppi_network.ipynb â€” Colab/Jupyter notebook
- ppi_data.tsv â€” raw STRING output
- ppi_network.png â€” plotted network image
- requirements.txt â€” packages needed

How to run:
1. Install packages: pip install pandas networkx matplotlib requests
2. Open the notebook and run all cells.

ðŸš€ How to Run on Google Colab
Open Google Colab.

Create a new notebook.

Paste the code from ppi_network_analysis.ipynb.

Modify the genes list if desired.

Run all cells to:

Query STRING API

Build the PPI network

Visualize and save the network graph

ðŸ“‚ Files in This Repository
ppi_network_analysis.ipynb â†’ Main Jupyter/Colab notebook containing the code.

ppi_network.png â†’ Saved PPI network image.

README.md â†’ Project description and usage guide.

requirements.txt â†’ List of required Python libraries (for local setup).

ðŸ“Š Output Example
The analysis produces a network graph where:

Nodes represent proteins.

Edges represent known or predicted protein-protein interactions.

Thicker edges = higher confidence score from STRING.

Example:
(Add screenshot of ppi_network.png here when available)

ðŸ“œ Data Source
STRING Database API
https://string-db.org
Species ID used in this example: 9606 (Homo sapiens).

ðŸ”® Future Improvements
Allow dynamic input of gene lists from a text file or CSV.

Add functional enrichment analysis of the network proteins.

Integrate with Cytoscape for advanced visualization.
