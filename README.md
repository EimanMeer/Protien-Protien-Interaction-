# Protein-Protein Interaction Network of Breast Cancer Genes

This project fetches protein interaction data from STRING for a small list of breast-cancer genes,
builds a network using NetworkX, and visualizes it.

Files:
- ppi_network.ipynb — Colab/Jupyter notebook
- ppi_data.tsv — raw STRING output
- ppi_network.png — plotted network image
- requirements.txt — packages needed

How to run:
1. Install packages: pip install pandas networkx matplotlib requests
2. Open the notebook and run all cells.
